    <span>This project was one of my last programs that I created for my computer science course in grade 11. I had so much fun exploring how pygame works and the different aspects that the module involves. In fact, this is the first place that I handled object oriented code as well as sprite groups.</span>

    <span class="lb">Before creating this game, I had no idea how to do anything using pygame or object oriented programing (OOP). After watching countless demo videos of other games such as <a href="https://kidscancode.org/blog/2016/09/pygame_shmup_part_11/">Astroids</a>, I was able to get a good idea of how pygame and sprite groups work. However, after I started coding, I couldn't stop. I had so much fun adding the different aspects to my game through the different object groups and custom events.</span>

    <span class="lb">Although I had an amazing time programming this game, I also ran into a few problems. For example, because of the time crunch I was in to get this project compleated, I could not figure out how to "kill" the duck after the player hit it so that only one point would be added to score for each duck the balloon collides with. I fixed these problems the best I could, but this game is far from being finished, and who knows, with a bit more time, I believe I could have created a fully functional game that included a starting screen, ending screen, and sound effects.</span>
