    <span> Being the final project in my grade eleven computer science class, I find it to also be the most challenging. This is mainly because it is the first time being exposed to languages such as css. With my time being limited for this creation, I had to figure out how to use all the different aspects that are a part of this portfolio fast. </span>

    <span class="lb">To save me time in making my portfolio, this project is based on <a href="https://github.com/crearo/portfolio">Rish Bhardwaj's</a> portfolio. Which is amazing by the way. After reading through the code for the project, I was able to plug in my own information, making the portfolio about me. In the end, this project can demonstrate my abilities as a programmer, creative thinker, and problem solver.</span>
