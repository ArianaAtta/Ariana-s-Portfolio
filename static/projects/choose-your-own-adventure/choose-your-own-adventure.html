    <span class="lb"> Suspenseful, nail-bitting, interesting, and fun was exactly what I aimed for while creating this terminal game. 
        This was one of the first projects that I tackled in the python language and let me say I had lots of fun.
        Even if this is a simple terminal game, I am so proud of this project as it was the first step in my python journey.

    <span class="lb"> Choose your own adventure uses user input to determine where the story is going to go.
        In the code, I used a series of if, elif, and else statments that were held in functions to control different options and senerios 
        in the game. In the end, this may have not been an extrodinary and impressive game. 
        However, it will always remain as one of my first and favourite creations.
