    <span>From Thunder Bay all the way to Kingston, this interactive map contains information which could potentially assist an individual with choosing the perfect campground according to their wants and needs. This map was one of my first visual creations using python on Visual Studio.After creating this, I was so proud that I was able to create such an amazing program.</span>

    <span class="lb">This map which shows the different campgrounds in Ontario uses folium and panda to create a fully interactive map where the user can see the camp size, popular fish, the average cost, number of trails, and how far each camp is from the nearest town or city. By using folium, I was able to pull data from a csv file containing all my lattitude and longetudes as well as all the information for each park, assign them each to lists where information was then zipped together in for loops to plot them on my map and create a visual representation for the user.</span>

    <span class="lb">While working on this map, it was the first time I was introduced to html. (even if it was simple html). Additionally, apart from teaching me the basics of html, I refered a lot to the <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/quickstart.html#Getting-Started">folium documentation</a>. By using this, I was able to do things that I would have never know how to do such as letting the user know to click each point to learn more. By exploring the endless possibilites that come with folium, I was able to take my creation to a whole new level and create something that I am compleatly satisfied with.</span>
